NodeJs Twitter Bot by @Gikdew
=========================================

Twitter Bot to manage your personal account, without taking any risks (more or less).
With this bot you can schedule tweets, follow people, unfollow them, retweet by an specific search and get stats of your account every 10 minutes.
The bot saves everything in differnent files (stats, consoleLog...).

If you want to program a tweet ad a file to the same folder of the bot called tweets.txt and the format of the tweet should be as follow:
<pre><code>04/30 17:20 Hi I'm a tweet</pre></code>
Where you get the date of tweeting and the text that will be tweet.
